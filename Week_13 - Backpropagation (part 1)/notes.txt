What is the slope of a line (наклон на линия)?
    - slope (also gradient) = direction + steepness of a line
    - often denoted by the letter m
    - calculated as the ratio of the vertical change to
        the horizontal change ("rise over run") between
        two distinct points on the line
        - through trigonometry, the slope "m" of a line is related to
            its angle of inclination θ by the tangent function
            m = tan(θ)
        - a 45° rising line has slope m = 1 (tan(45) = 1)
        - a 45° falling line has slope m = -1 (tan(-45) = -1)

What is the steepness of a line (колко стръмна е линия)?
    - the absolute value of its slope: greater absolute value indicates a steeper line.
    - direction is defined as follows:
        - positive slope (m > 0): an increasing line going up from left to right
            - m = 1 => 45° rising line
        - negative slope (m < 0): a decreasing line going down from left to right
            - m = -1 => -45° falling line
        - zero slope (m = 0): a horizontal line (the graph of a constant function)
        - undefined / infinite slope: a vertical line


Suppose a line runs through two points: P = (1, 2) and Q = (13, 8).
    What is its slope?
        m = dy / dx
        dy = 8 - 2 = 6
        dx = 13 - 1 = 12
        m = 6 / 12 = 1 / 2
        Direction: 1/2 > 0 => positive => up
        Steepness: 0 < 1/2 < 1 => not very steep
    

Suppose a line runs through two points: P = (4, 15) and Q = (3, 21).
    What is its slope?
        m = dy / dx
        dy = 21 - 15 = 6
        dx = 3 - 4 = -1
        m = 6 / (-1) = -6
        Direction: -6 < 0 => down
        Steepness: |-6| = 6 > 1 => steep


Derivatives

Backpropagation
    Calculating derivatives of the loss function with respect to every value node leading up to it.
    Rules of thumb:
        + => copy gradient to parents
            parent1.grad = current.grad
            parent2.grad = current.grad
        * => multiply value of other parent with current gradient
            parent1.grad = parent2.value * current.grad
            parent2.grad = parent1.value * current.grad
    Show backpropagation using task 10.
