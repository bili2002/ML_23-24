Continue your work on the [Churn for Bank Customers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers/data). Use a linear SVM and a kernel SVM. Create a table `df_result` analogous to the one we created in class and compare the models to `KNN`, `LogisticRegression`, `random guess` and `most frequent guess`.
