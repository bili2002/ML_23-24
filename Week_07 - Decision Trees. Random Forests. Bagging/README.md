The [wine quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) can be treated as both a classification and a regression task. Use all of the algorithms we've learned so far (including `svm`, `decision trees` and `random forests`) to predict the `quality` column. There are two `.csv` files - `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`. You'll have to merge them into a single dataset and use it for model training, inference and evaluation.

Follow the methodology shown in class: First **univariate** exploratory data analysis and only after that comes data preparation and data modelling.

## Task 1

Solve the task using classification algorithms.

## Task 2

Solve the task using regression algorithms.
